  Implicit iterators.
    A single period (`.`) may now be used as a name in Interpolation tags,
    which represents the top of stack (cast as a String).
  Dotted names.
    Names containing one or more periods should be resolved as chained
    properties; naïvely, this is like nesting section tags, but with some
    built-in scoping protections.
